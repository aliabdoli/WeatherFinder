# WeatherFinder
Testing:
	* Although I have hands-on experience on Jasmine (to test AngularJs code) I have not used it (time limit)
	* Unit test is done only for a few classes which I think the rest of classes can be done in the same way
	* Design is done to make code more testable (please as an example have a look at GlobalWeatherServiceClient)
Coding
	* Although I have experience on Css compilers like LESS for the sake of the time I have not implemented it.
	* Still more improvement on design is doable, however, to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to a test project I skipped it
